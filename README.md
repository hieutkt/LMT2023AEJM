Replication codes for Lanteri, Andrea, Pamela Medina, and Eugene Tan. “Capital-Reallocation Frictions and Trade Shocks.” American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics 15, no. 2 (April 2023): 190–228. https://doi.org/10.1257/mac.20200429.

Hieu Nguyen, Yudong Rao, and Cristian Valencia replicated and extended the model for their final project in the course '5725 Quantitative Methods in Macroeconomics' in WashU.
For presentation slides, see [presentation slides](./WashU_5725_Final_project_slides_.pdf).

## Matlab code

We modify the code to study a 'persistent' Covid shock on the steady state after the China trade shock.

Run `Matlab/master.m` to regenerate all the figure in the presentation slides.
Generated figures are put in the folder `Matlab/CHY_figures`.

## Dofiles 

We motivate the Covid in Peru with some data. 
The code to generate this data is in the `/Stata` folder, in `main.do`.
